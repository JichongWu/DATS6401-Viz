by Jichong Wu, May 1 2022


- The FTP_Full_Wu .py file has the full code including data pre-processing. However, it may incorrectinly dipplay some error looking message such as "fobbiden 403", that's why I split up the code into three parts.

 - The FTP_After_Data_Clean_Wu has the code for data analysis and visulization.

 - The FTP_Dash_Wu has the Dash App code.

 - Each of the three .py files can be run separately with no issues and errors, because a cleaned dataset will be download into the code from my personal cloud on Github.
